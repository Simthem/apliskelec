<p> The overall requirements are:
 - Management of employee work sites with ease of visualizing the hours worked by each and listing of different data (ID’s of worksites, descriptions of troubleshooting, working days with total hours, names of employees, dates, etc.)

 The result is therefore:
 - Management of an account in super-admin with permissions to create/ modify/ delete a user account with limited permissions (employee)

 Super Admin account requirements:
 - Creation of a database allowing the management of user accounts, site Ids/descriptions of the various troubleshooting operations as well as the export of each of the data (no automated export)
 - Management of troubleshooting labels involves creation, the modification of the name/ places but above all it will allow to assign them an ID’s which will correspond to a new site and will imply by default the deletion of the descriptions of the troubleshooting category

 User account requirements:
 - No permission to create/ modify/ delete ID’s from worksites and user accounts
 - Schedule management (working time spent by ID’s of construction sites/troubleshooting labels) with (if possible) a prohibition on filling in forms corresponding to the day even if the form of the/ of the days preceding a(ont) not been completed(s)
